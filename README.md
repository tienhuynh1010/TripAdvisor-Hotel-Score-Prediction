This repository focuses on building and analyzing machine learning models to predict hotel scores on TripAdvisor. The project leverages user reviews, hotel attributes, and surrounding attractions to estimate ratings, helping travelers make informed decisions and enabling hotels to improve their services.

Features:
Dataset Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data, including numerical and categorical features like amenities, distance to metro, number of reviews, and hotel ratings.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distribution and detecting outliers using boxplots and other statistical methods.
Feature Engineering: Incorporating variables such as no_of_amenities, dist_to_metro, no_of_attractions, award, and sentiment scores from user reviews.
Model Development: Building and tuning predictive models, including regression and ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Stacking).
Evaluation Metrics: Using RMSE, MAE, and R^2 to evaluate model performance.

Applications:
For Users: Predict personalized ratings for hotels based on preferences.
For Hotels: Gain insights into factors affecting ratings and customer satisfaction.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
